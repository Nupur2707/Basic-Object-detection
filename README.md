# Object Detection Using Python

## Overview
This project provides an object detection system using Python. The system leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect objects in images or live video feeds. It is designed to be easily extendable and customizable for different use cases.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using a webcam or external camera.
- Support for various pre-trained models.
- Customizable detection parameters.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A webcam or external camera (for real-time detection)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-python.git
    cd object-detection-python
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the object detection script:
    ```bash
    python detect.py
    ```
2. The system will begin detecting objects in the specified images or live camera feed.

## Customization
To customize the object detection model, follow these steps:
1. Open `config.py` and modify the settings as needed.
2. Replace the pre-trained model with your own model by placing it in the `models/` directory and updating the path in `detect.py`.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.
